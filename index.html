            Shapefile</a> is <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">old file format for
            storing geospatial vector data</a>. It has been around since early
    1990s. It is still used as most common exchange vector data format.
    </p>
    <p>The geospatial IT industry made a huge step since then, yet the Shapefile
    is still most common file format for sharing vector data.
    </p>
    <p>
    Shapefile was great format in it's time and the fact, it's still used
    today, proofs, that it's design was truly eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yet we believe, the time of the Shapefile has passed and we, the Geospatial
    IT Industry shall replace it with more modern concepts. Shapefile is now
    outdated format and should be abandoned in the future for sharing of
    geospatial vector data.

    <h2>The good side</h2>
    <p>
        Not all Shapefile features do make it bad (or unmodern) format. There is
        a couple of features, why Shapefile is still beating most of other
        formats:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's open format. Even proprietary, the specification is open and
                implemented wildly.</li>
        <li>Shapefile is by far mostly supported format. If every other format
                fails, Shapefile is always supported</li>
        <li>For most of the usecases, it appears to be <em>good
                        enough</em>.</li>
        <li>It appears to be relatively efficient - the resulting file, even
                un-ziped - is relatively small, compared to some other, mostly
                text-based formats.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="alert-heading">Shapefile is bad format</h2>
    <p>Why is Shapefile so bad? Here are several reasons, why the Shapefile is
    bad format and you should avoid it's usage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#multifile">It's multifile format</a>. You can not
                    share just one file, you always need to send at least 3, or zip them together</li>
        <li><a href="#10characters">Attribute names are limited to 10
                        characters</a>. If you need longer attribute names, you
                are lost.</li>
        <li><a href="#255attributes">Only 255 attributes</a>. The DBF file does
                not allow to store more then 255 attribute fields.</li>
        <li><a href="#datatypes">Limitted data types</a>. Data types are limited
                to float, integer, date and text with maximum 254
                characters.</li>
        <li><a href="#characterset">Unknown character set</a>. There is now way
                how to specify character set used in the database.</li>
        <li><a href="#sizelimit">It's limited to 2GB of file size</a>. Even some
                tools are able to overpass this limit, they can never exceed 4GB
                of data.</li>
        <li><a href="#simplefeature">No topology in the data</a>. There is no

        <li><a href="#hierarchy">More complicated data structures are impossible

    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="#multifile"></a>
    <h3>Multifile format</h3>
    <p>
    The Shapefile uses <a
       href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile#Overview">at least 3
       files</a>, but there are up to 10 other file extensions, which can be
       distributed along with the Shapefile. Nearly every geospatial software
       package is adding it's own extension to try to overcome some of the
       limit's Shapefile has.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is highly unpractical for distribution of the data. User usually
        has to zip all the files into one archive - and unzip it on the other
        end of the distribution chain.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="#10characters"></a>
    <h3>10 Characters attribute names</h3>
    <p>
        Attribute names are limited to 10 characters at maximum. Longer names
        are usually automatically shorten. This is limiting to some application
        and leads to bad data arrangement.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="#255attributes"></a>
    <h3>255 attribute fields</h3>
    <p>
        There can be only 255 attribute fields in the database file. For some
        application this is limiting especially in combination with the <a
       href="#hierarchy">flat table structure</a>.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="#datatypes"></a>
    <h3>Poor support for attribute data types</h3>
    <p>
        Float, integer, date and character string data types are supported. But
        floating point numbers are stored as text, there is no support for big
        integers (thus the format is not usable, you are having data with big
        integer identifiers, such as cadastral map) and the text is limited to
        254 characters only. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no support for more advanced data fields, blobs etc.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="characterset"></a>
    <h3>Unknown character set</h3>
    <p>
        There is now way how to specify character set used in the database. Most
        of the applications are using the old Windows-* or ISO-* data encodings,
        but nowadays, we are using UTF-8. Still there is no way how to specify
        this in file header.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support for Unicode characters is also very limited.
    </p>
    </div>


    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="#sizelimit"></a>
    <h3>2GB Size limit</h3>
    <p>
        The size of both .shp and .dbf component files cannot exceed 2 GB. <a
       href="http://www.gdal.org/drv_shapefile.html">GDAL Shapefile driver</a>
        overcomes this limit, but 
    </p>

        <blockquote><p>The Shapefile format explicitly uses 32bit offsets and so cannot go
        over 8GB (it actually uses 32bit offsets to 16bit words), but the OGR shapefile
        implementation has a limitation to 4GB.
                </p>
                <p>
        However, for compatibility with other software implementation, it is not recommended to use a file size over 2GB for both .SHP and .DBF files.
                </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>So 4GB is all you can have in single Shapefile. This sounds enough,
        but not for all cases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="#simplefeature"></a>
    <h3>Non-topological format</h3>
    <p>
        Shapefile is simple-feature format. There is no way, how to store more
        complex geometry relationships.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert" role="alert">
    <a name="#mixedgeometry"></a>
    <h3>No mixed geometry</h3>
    <p>
        Each file can be only one of the supported geometry formats (Point,
        Line, Polygon and others). Mixed geometry features are not possible.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    <a name="#hierarchy"></a>
    <h3>Flat data structure</h3>
    <p>
        The data structure is limited to <em>flat</em> tables with no
        hierarchies, relations or tree structure.

    <h2>Alternatives</h2>
    <img class="format-logo img-thumbnail" src="images/prefer-geopackage.png"/>
    <p>
    What are the alternatives for the Shapefile? To be honest, no alternative
    format did take over Shapefiles hegemony yet. Some of the formats nearly
    took over (KML, GML, GeoJSON), but their usage was limited for relatively
    narrow use cases only.
    </p>
    <p>
    Although there are <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html">more then
            80 used vector data formats</a> out there, only few can be
    considered as the candidate for Shapefile replacement.

            GML was picked as the main distribution vector data format the European

            daily praxis. One of the issues is, that in order to being able to process
            the data file, it has to be loaded into computer memory, which makes it very
            difficult to be used for large vector data sets.
            </p>

            <p>
                SpatiaLite is an open source library intended to extend the SQLite core
                to support fully fledged Spatial SQL capabilities.
                SQLite is intrinsically simple and lightweight:
            </p>
            <ul>
                    <li>a single lightweight library implementing the full SQL engine</li>
                    <li>standard SQL implementation: almost complete SQL-92</li>
                    <li>a whole database simply corresponds to a single monolithic file
                            (no size limits)</li>
                    <li>any DB-file can be safely exchanged across different platforms,
                            because the internal architecture is universally
                            portable</li>
            </p>
            <p>
            To us, SpatiaLite seems to be the second best option after the <a
               href="#geopackage">GeoPackage</a> possibility. They do build on top of
               the same technology, which is SQLite.
            </p>
            <p>
            Compared to GeoPackage, it lacks support for extensions and support for
            raster data - that is certainly not a must-have feature, but it's good, if
            we take this into consideration.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            Among non-GeoSpatial people, the CSV is very popular, but for most of
            GeoSpatial applications it's unusable format.
            </p>
            <p>
            At least two reasons for not using CSV as Shapefile replacement: It's not
            standardized (there are many dialects out there), support for non-point
            geospatial data is complicated.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
            Some years back, the KML format was very popular, but the geospatial
            community hit on it's limits. Since XML based, it's not suitable for bigger
            data data sets. It combines cartography along with the data geometry in one
            file, what does not seem to be good sollution. And it officially supports
            only WGS-84 coordinate reference system.

                    <li>File size groves fast</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>GeoJSON is very simple, human-readable, text-based format. Although it
            was design to support WGS-84 only, it's possible to use it for other
            coordinate reference systems too. It can handle complex vector data
            features, build complex hierarchical data models.
            </p>
            <p>
            The problem with GeoJSON is, that the file grows very fast with amount of
            coordinate pairs needed to be stored. Indexing and other advanced features
            is not possible too.
